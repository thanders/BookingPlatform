**Note about Maven dependency scope**:

**Compile** is the default scope. Compile dependencies are available in all classpaths of a project.

**Runtime** - indicates that the dependency is not required for compilation, but is for execution. It is in the runtime and test classpaths, but not the compile classpath.

**Test** - indicates that the dependency is not required for normal use of the application, and is only available for the test compilation and execution phases. This scope is not transitive.
